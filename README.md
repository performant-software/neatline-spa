## Neatline Single Page Application (Neatline SPA)

This repository contains the front end components of Neatline, a suite of tools for scholars, students, and curators to tell stories with maps and timelines. Neatline SPA is in active development. This application relies on a separate back end adapter, called [Neatline Omeka S](https://github.com/performant-software/neatline-omeka-s) to provide API endpoints for its data storage and retrieval. That adapter can also include a bundled build of this SPA, to make it easy to installÂ Neatline for Omeka S in one step.

### Development Setup
For development purposes, this repository is included as a git submodule in the Neatline adapter for Omeka S. To use an Omeka S instance as the environment for Neatline SPA installation and/or development, please see the instructions at https://github.com/performant-software/neatline-omeka-s.
